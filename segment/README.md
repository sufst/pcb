# Segment PCB Info

To comply with isolation requirements for HV and LV, this design has been split
up into two PCBs. The "HV" board provides the fusing and connections for the
voltage taps. The "LV" board provides the connections to the thermistors and
merges their grounds. The boards are designed to be stacked vertically with
the LV board on top of the HV board. The boards should be connected via an 
insulating material and should be separated either by at least 30mm of air
or be separated by a barrier of moisture resistant, insulating material.
